#### 具体给出立场 ...部分内容

只用1-2个核心词来概括这个展开段的大方向

把一句话拆成两句写，将高级词汇写到扩充的第二句话中

### 论证

#### 因果关系

1. 因果逻辑连接词
- because 更强调原因
- since/as 更强调结果

2. Lead
- SVO. This can lead to + 结果

    前后两句权重一致

- SVO. This can lead to 直接结果, leading to/which can lead to + 补充结果

    主句权重更高

    两个lead造成重复，有两种改善方式
    - 使用连接词
        - Because SVO, SVO, leading to ...  
        - By doing sth, SVO, leading to ...
    - 同义词替换
        - 结果：SVO, resulting in sth.
        - 使得：SVO, allowing/enabling sb to do sth.
        - 促使：SVO, contributing to ...
        - 促进：SVO, encouraging/driving/motivating sb to do sth.
        - 起到重要作用：SVO, which plays an important role in doing sth.
        - 更具体的替换：
            - SVO, promoting/reduing ...
            - SVO, stengthening/weakening ...
            - SVO, making it easier/more difficult to do ...
        - 用factor替换：
            - A is a contributing factor to B
            - A is a factor that contributes to B

3. therefore、as a result、consequently

    用法：SVO. Therefore, SVO.

    引导完整句，总结性很强

4. thus/thereby、in turn

    附加在已经表示因果关系的句子上，进一步增加语气

5. which means

    用法：SVO, which means + 导致一个结果
